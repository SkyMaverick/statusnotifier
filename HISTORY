!!! Renaming of StatusNotifier to StatusNotifierItem, and all functions from
    status_notifier_XXX to status_notifier_item_XXX

    Yes, this breaks things. It's unfortunate, but we didn't really follow the
    GObject convention for naming things, and as a result it made things a bit
    awkward/complicated when it comes to introspection, and bindings to use
    statusnotifier from other languages (e.g. Perl).

    There was no other changes, only typedef/functions/macros renamed, so fixing
    code written for previous version is only a matter or search&replace.

    Note that a statusnotifier-compat.h is provided, that defines a bunch of
    macros and should allow old code to keep working without any changes
    required, only this extra include. As a transitional aid of sorts.

+++ Add optional dbusmenu support via libdbusmenu

+++ Add optional generation of introspection data. Thanks to Frédéric Buclin for
    his help.

 +  Update to newer specs; Add item-is-menu

 !  Fix possibly using wrong scroll orientation

 !  Fix getting/setting property window-id

 *  Other fixes/cleanups; see git log for details
